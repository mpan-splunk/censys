When using the <i>query ip</i>, <i>query domain</i> and <i>query certificate</i> actions, the full Censys search syntax may be used within the query. For examples and syntax help, see <a href="https://search.censys.io/certificates/help?q=&" target="_blank">the certificate search documentation</a> and similar pages.

<h3>Note:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>'Lookup Domain' and 'Query Domain' actions will not work in this version of the app as Censys has not added support for these actions in API V2. For more details refer to pdf attached to this <a href="https://support.censys.io/hc/en-us/articles/4404436837652-Search-1-0-and-IPv4-Banners-Deprecated-Resources-and-Available-Alternatives" target="_blank">Censys page</a>.</li>
  <li>
    'Query IP' and 'Query Certificate' action makes 1 API call for every 100 results. For example, to fetch the 5000 results, 50 API calls will be made. If a query is fired for large number of records and the limit specified in the limit parameter is too large, user's account may exceed the query quota provided by Censys.
  </li>
  <li>
    As per the limit provided by Censys, 'Query Certificate' action can fetch only 25,000 data at max.
